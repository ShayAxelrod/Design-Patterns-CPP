# Strategy Pattern ðŸ¦†

*Also Known As (Policy)*

> Definition: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

**Strategy Pattern.cpp**
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <vector>
#include "MallardDuck.h"
#include "RubberDuck.h"
#include "DecoyDuck.h"

using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<shared_ptr<Duck>> ducks;
    shared_ptr<Duck> mallard = make_shared<MallardDuck>();
    shared_ptr<Duck> rubber = make_shared<RubberDuck>();
    shared_ptr<Duck> decoy = make_shared<DecoyDuck>();    

    ducks.push_back(mallard);
    ducks.push_back(rubber);
    ducks.push_back(decoy);

    for (auto duck : ducks) {
        duck->display();
        duck->performFly();
        duck->performQuack();
    }

    return 0;
}
```
**Console:**
```
I'm a MallardDuck.
I can fly.
Quack!
I'm a RubberDuck.
I can't fly.
Squeak!
I'm a DecoyDuck.
I can't fly.
I make no sound!
```
